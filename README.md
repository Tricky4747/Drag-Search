Instructions:

Setup: Clone or download the files. Once you change directory to the installed folder, type these commands in the terminal

Then, install Tesseract from here: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
And save it to C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\

Execution: First, Take a screenshot that saves the image with the text to the clipboard. You can use WIN + Shift + S, or any other screenshot app that lets you copy to clipboard.

PS: Works best to search up questions that your teacher asks in zoom class presentations ;)
